# Manual checks

> ✨ Written with AI assistance.

The tests stop at HTTP: nothing here runs a browser, so anything JavaScript, CSS or assistive technology does is checked by hand. This list says what to check and how. It is also the starting point if browser tests are added later. Add to it whenever a change does something in the browser that a test cannot see.

Run `npm run build` in `frontend/` first, so the browser gets the current JavaScript and CSS.

## How to check

| What | How, in Chrome (Firefox and Safari have equivalents) |
|---|---|
| Without JavaScript | DevTools, then ⌘⇧P, "Disable JavaScript", and reload. Turn it back on the same way. |
| Keyboard only | Put the mouse aside. Tab and Shift-Tab move between controls; Space or Enter presses a button; the arrow keys move a slider. The focused control should always be visible. |
| Screen reader | On macOS, VoiceOver: ⌘F5 turns it on and off, and Control-Option with the arrow keys reads through the page. Listen for what is announced when something changes without the page reloading. |
| Reduced motion | DevTools, the ⋮ menu, More tools, Rendering, then "Emulate CSS media feature prefers-reduced-motion: reduce". |
| Phone width | DevTools' device toolbar (⌘⇧M), at a width around 375px. |

## Autosaved answers (long text, 1–10 scale)

- Typing or choosing shows "Saved"; changing the answer again clears it; a slow save shows "Saving…".
- With the server stopped, a save says "Not saved. Check your connection, then try again."
- A refused answer shows its reason where "Saved" would be.
- Near the 20,000-character limit, the text box says how many characters are left.
- Without JavaScript, a Save button appears and saves the answer. With JavaScript it is hidden.
- Screen reader: "Saved" and a refusal are announced.

## The sort

- The cards come in a different order on each visit. The counter reads "1/36" and counts up.
- Each bucket button places the card, the card flies (left for the weaker buckets, right for the stronger, down for the middle one), and the bucket's count goes up.
- Undo goes back one card at a time, all the way to the first, and is disabled when there is nothing to undo. It also works on the "All 36 sorted!" screen.
- Continuing is offered only once all 36 are sorted.
- The step labels read "Step 1 of 2 — Sort" and "Step 2 of 2 — Fine-tune".
- Fine-tuning groups the statements under their buckets, strongest first, leaves out any empty bucket, and starts each slider at its bucket's seed (85, 65, 45, 25, 10 in Whatever You Do).
- Submitting without touching a slider still gives a complete result.
- "See my results" goes to the results page, and cannot be pressed twice while it is sending.
- After a sort is in, the section shows a link to the results instead of the sort. Submitting a second sort from another tab that still shows the sort says "Your results are already in…", not a connection error.
- Without JavaScript, the sort's place says it needs JavaScript.
- Keyboard only: the whole sort and fine-tune can be done. Focus stays on the bucket button just pressed, and moves to the new heading when the screen changes.
- Screen reader: each new card is announced ("Card 2 of 36: …"), and each slider is read with its statement.
- Reduced motion: cards change without flying.
- Phone width: the bucket buttons stack, and a flying card never makes the page scroll sideways.

## Results

- PEP bars that tie share a colour.
- A 0% bar: the prototype gave every PEP bar at least 4% width so a zero still showed a stub. Check with real sorts whether it is missed (ticket 07).
